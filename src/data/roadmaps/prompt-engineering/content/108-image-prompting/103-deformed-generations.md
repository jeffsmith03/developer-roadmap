# Fix Deformed Generations
In the context of image outputting with Large Language Models (LLMs), "Fix Deformed Generations" refers to the process of addressing or improving the generation of images that contain deformities or inaccuracies, particularly in human body parts like hands or feet.


Deformed generations can occur when generating images using LLMs, and it is a common issue with many models. However, there are techniques and strategies that can help mitigate this problem. One approach involves using negative prompts to guide the model towards generating more accurate and realistic images. By providing explicit instructions about what should be avoided or corrected, the model can generate images with improved quality and fewer deformities.


For example, using a negative prompt like "disfigured, deformed hands, blurry, grainy, broken" with a lower weight or negative weight can help the model generate images with better hand representations. By explicitly specifying the desired qualities and avoiding deformities, the model can produce more convincing and visually appealing results.
